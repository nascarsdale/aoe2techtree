#aoe2techtree

This is a series of python codes that I wrote (for some reason)
to query the AOE2 tech tree. 

Something important to know is that not all the techs have the same
name as they do in the tech tree. For example, "bracer" keeps the same
name, but the other blacksmith upgrades have been changed to "melee 
attack N" (where N is 1,2, or 3), "cavalry armor N", "archer armor N", 
and "infantry armor N". 

Everything is lowercase. I have generally tried to keep the same name 
as the tech tree for non-blacksmith techs and units(e.g., "skirmisher" 
instead of "skirm"). 

If there is confusion, run "print-all-units.py" which will print the 
name of everything listed. 

Because the tech tree I referenced is the readily available one at 
aoe2techtree.net, which is current to the latest DE release, there 
might be some version issues with this and HD.

No civ bonuses are included here; if I get bored again I might put in
a category for that but who knows.
